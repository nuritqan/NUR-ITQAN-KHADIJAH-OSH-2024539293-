    Reading has always been one of my favorite hobbies. I enjoy diving into
    fantasy novels, learning new things, and exploring different worlds
    through books. Whenever I have free time, I like to sit by the window
    with a cup of tea and immerse myself in a good story.

  <p>This is an unfinished drawing of mine because i do not have enough time for it. However, this helps me relaxed my mind every single time so i will come back on this and draw few strokes each time.</p>
